## Q1
You are given an array of integers a. A new array b is generated by rearranging the elements of a in the following way:

b[0] is equal to a[0];
b[1] is equal to the last element of a;
b[2] is equal to a[1];
b[3] is equal to the second-last element of a;
b[4] is equal to a[2];
b[5] is equal to the third-last element of a;
and so on.
Your task is to determine whether the new array b is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Here is how the process of generating the new array b works:

## Q2

Given an array of positive integers a, your task is to calculate the sum of every possible a[i] ∘ a[j], where a[i] ∘ a[j] is the concatenation of the string representations of a[i] and a[j] respectively.

Example

For a = [10, 2], the output should be solution(a) = 1344.

a[0] ∘ a[0] = 10 ∘ 10 = 1010,
a[0] ∘ a[1] = 10 ∘ 2 = 102,
a[1] ∘ a[0] = 2 ∘ 10 = 210,
a[1] ∘ a[1] = 2 ∘ 2 = 22.//	var sum int64 = 4
	n := len(a)
	// nested for loop
	for i :=0 ; i<n; i++ {
		for j := 0; j<n; j++ {
			if i != j {
				tempsum := int64(a[i])
				attach := int64(a[j])
				for attach > 0 {
					tempsum *= 10
					attach /= 10
				}
			attach += int64(a[j])
			sum += tempsum
			}
		}
	}
	return sum
	}
